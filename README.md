# Installation

[https://ahmadawais.com/install-go-lang-on-macos-with-homebrew/](https://ahmadawais.com/install-go-lang-on-macos-with-homebrew/)

I started with `brew install go` and the Go VSCode plugin.

I had to modify PATH and set GOPATH and GOROOT to make the sublime go plugin to work.

    export GOROOT="$(brew --prefix golang)/libexec"
    export PATH="$PATH:${GOROOT}/bin"
    export GOPATH="${HOME}/.go"

As [this document](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH) says, you only need to set one GOPATH. I created that using this one-time shell command, **after** defining GOPATH as described above:
`test -d "${GOPATH}" || mkdir "${GOPATH}"`

After this, I can run simple Go scripts directly in Sublime edit by usin the `âŒ˜B` key-chord.
